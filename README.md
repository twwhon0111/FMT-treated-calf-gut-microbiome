## QIIME2 is an open-source bioinformatics pipeline. Please, refer to the "Natively installing QIIME2 (https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/install/native/)" to install and run the QIIME2 software.

## Typical install time on a normal desktop computer is about 30 minutes.

## A directory of preliminary_trial contains feature table, manifest, metadata, and readme txt files for Illumina-generated bovine fecal bacterial sequences. Fecal samples were collected 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). A total of 37 (donor calf, n = 1; recipient calves, n = 36) fresh fecal samples were used for the metataxonomic analysis.

## A directory of validation_trial contains feature table, manifest, metadata, and readme txt files for Illumina-generated bovine fecal bacterial sequences. Fecal samples were collected 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 48 days after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). A total of 450 (CON, n = 108; ABX, n = 176; FMT, n = 166) fresh fecal samples were used for the metataxonomic analysis.

## A directory of 12_month_old_cattle contains manifest, metadata, and readme txt files for Illumina-generated bovine fecal bacterial sequences. Fecal samples were collected 12 months after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). A total of 450 (CON, n = 108; ABX, n = 176; FMT, n = 166) fresh fecal samples were used for the metataxonomic analysis.

## DEMO_dataset contains a small dataset to demo the software/code, instruction to run on data, expected output, and expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer.

## To see the detailed usage of these datasets, please, read the readme under each directory.
